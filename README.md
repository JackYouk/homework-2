# homework-2 Portfolio Website
## By Jack Youkstetter

Deployed app: https://jackyouk.github.io/portfolio-website-beta/

Beta version of my Portfolio website, programmed from scratch using vanilla HTML and CSS.
Website is fully functional regardless of screen size (using media queries), and it includes psuedo elements in the header, nav bar, and elsewhere.
All links are responsive, either taking the user to a section of the website or to another web application (i.e. google pdf of resume, github, twitter, etc.)
The "my work" section of the website is fully functional, however content is yet to be added.
